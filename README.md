## Description

This is JATE, Just Another Text Editor. This application is similar to notepad, the default text editor application that comes pre downloaded on windows operating system. My motivation for this project was to get hands-on experience with PWA's. In working with this code I learned a lot about webpack configuration, service workers and the overall concept of PWA's. I was able to make the app downloadable to work offline and still function as it would online.
